The application provides an HTTP API for companies and end-users, is integrated with an external anti-fraud service, and uses PostgreSQL and Redis for data storage and caching.

## üìù About the Application

This document outlines the functionality of the **Promo Code API**, a comprehensive platform designed to connect businesses with end-users through promotional offers. The application is logically divided into two primary sections: a **Business-to-Business (B2B)** interface for companies to manage their campaigns and a **Business-to-Consumer (B2C)** interface for users to discover, interact with, and activate promotions.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

This platform provides a comprehensive solution for managing promotional campaigns, with a clear separation between B2B and B2C interfaces.

* **üë§ Dual Account System:** Supports separate registration and authentication for **Companies (B2B)** and **Users (B2C)**. The same email can be used for both a company and a user account.

* **üîê Secure Authentication & Authorization:**
    * **JWT-based authentication** for all protected endpoints (`Authorization: Bearer {token}`).
    * Utilizing **Argon2** hashing algorithm**.
    * Successful sign-in **invalidates all previously issued tokens** for that specific account.
    * Strict ownership checks ensure companies and users can only access and manage their own resources (promos, comments, etc.).

* **üìà Advanced B2B Promo Management:**
    * **Flexible Promo Creation:** Supports two distinct types:
        * `COMMON`: A single, reusable code (e.g., `SUMMER-SALE-20`) with a configurable usage limit.
        * `UNIQUE`: A list of unique, single-use codes for tracking specific campaigns.
    * **Precise Audience Targeting:** Define rules for each promo based on user **age** and **country**.
    * **Powerful Listing & Filtering:** Retrieve promo lists with pagination, case-insensitive filtering (by country), and sorting (by start/end date).
    * **Performance Analytics:** A dedicated endpoint (`/stat`) provides detailed activation statistics for each promo, broken down by country.

* **üõçÔ∏è Rich B2C User Experience:**
    * **Personalized Promo Feed:** Users get a curated feed of active promos that match their profile's targeting settings.
    * **Robust Activation Logic:** A promo can only be activated if it is active, the user matches targeting rules, usage limits are not met, and a mandatory **anti-fraud check** passes.
    * **Community Interaction:** Users can **like/unlike** promos and engage in discussions through a full **CRUD system for comments**.
    * **Activation History:** Users can view a complete history of all the promo codes they have previously activated.

* **üõ°Ô∏è Core System & Reliability:**
    * **Anti-Fraud Integration:** Every activation attempt is validated by an external anti-fraud service. Results are **persistently cached in Redis** to optimize performance.
    * **Idempotent Actions:** Operations like liking or unliking a promo are idempotent, ensuring repeated requests do not cause unintended side effects.
    * **Health Check:** A simple `GET /api/ping` endpoint to verify service availability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **Backend:** Python, Django, Django REST Framework
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL
-   **Caching:** Redis
-   **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
-   **External Service:** Antifraud-service

---

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Docker:** ‚â• 27.3.1
- **Docker Compose:** ‚â•¬†2.30 
- **Git:** ‚â•¬†2.44.0 

## üöÄ Installation and Setup

The application and all its dependencies are launched using Docker Compose and configured via environment variables.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RandomProgramm3r/Promo-Code-API.git
    cd Promo-Code-API
    ```

2.  **Create and configure the `.env` file:**
    Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`. The `docker-compose.yml` is configured to use these variables for all services.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    Execute the following command in the project's root directory to build the images and run the containers in the background:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```

4.  **Apply database migrations:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec web sh -c "cd promo_code && python manage.py migrate"
    ```

    After a successful launch, the main service will be available on the host machine at **`http://localhost:8000`**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

All project configuration is managed through an `.env` file.

* `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`: A secret key for a particular Django installation.
* `DJANGO_DEBUG`: Toggles Django's debug mode (`True` / `False`).
* `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`: A list of strings representing the host/domain names that this Django site can serve.

* `POSTGRES_USERNAME`: Username for PostgreSQL connection.
* `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Password for PostgreSQL connection.
* `POSTGRES_HOST`: Host for PostgreSQL connection (e.g., `db`).
* `POSTGRES_PORT`: Port for PostgreSQL connection (e.g., `5432`).
* `POSTGRES_DATABASE`: The name of the database to use.

* `REDIS_HOST`: Host for Redis connection (e.g., `redis`).
* `REDIS_PORT`: Port for Redis connection (e.g., `6379`).

* `ANTIFRAUD_ADDRESS`: The address (domain or IP) and port of the anti-fraud service API (e.g., `http://antifraud:9090`).
